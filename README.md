# Semantic Segmentation

In this project, Fully Convolutional Network for labeling the pixels of a road in images was created.

### Dataset
Net was trained on [Kitti Road dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_road.php) from [here](http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_road.zip).

### Train parameters

Net was trained for 30 epochs with batch size of 2 images and learning rate 1e-3.

### Train results

Result IoU was 92.6%

Result images can be found in `./runs/1540306797.5023372` directory.
